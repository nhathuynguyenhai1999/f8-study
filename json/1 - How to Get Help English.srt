00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,130
‫Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,690
‫My name is Steven Grider, and in this course, I'm going to teach you everything I know about SJS before

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,220
‫we get started.

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,940
‫However, just a couple of very quick notes.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,110
‫I want to go over specifically how you can get help if you ever get stuck as you working through this

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,490
‫course.

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,690
‫So if you get stuck at any point in time, the best place to go for help is that you'd make a discussion

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,000
‫board.

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,800
‫I have one or two teachers who watched the discussion in this course.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,970
‫And if you ever have a question, just post your question and hopefully one, those ideas will be able

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,900
‫to answer your question.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,680
‫If you do not get help there, you can always check out my Dischord server.

13
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,020
‫Discord is a kind of chat application.

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,370
‫If you want to join my Dischord server, you can find a link to it in the next lecture.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,840
‫So the video right after this one.

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,000
‫And then finally, last way to get help.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,190
‫You can always direct message me on me.

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,890
‫OK, so now you've got this little bit of administrative stuff out of the way, let's dive into the

19
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,690
‫world of Nest in the next video.
